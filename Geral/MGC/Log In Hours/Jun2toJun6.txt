- Description: Research to fill "Description" and "Project Name" entries in FDI dataset, mostly looking at aidData for possible datasets. Nothing of interest came from initial aidData search, download and analysis of world bank dataset with China FDI netflows, however no obvious use for it yet.

- Description: Check Greenfield ("G") accuracy with random manual search on the AIIB dataset. Choose 20 random projects that were not assigned a "G", read their descriptions and summary and determine whether or not they are Greenfield. Keep track of which project, why I believe the description indicates the classification is correct/incorrect. Each project takes around 10 minutes to read, classify and annotate (justification + possible key words list for fixing).

- Total hours: 2h40
- Description: Since I found many misclassifications from the "No G" group, conduct a similar check for the ones that were assigned a "G". Take 10 projects and do a similar process (10min/project. First part takes about 1h30. Next, since there are many mistakes in the original classification process, do a search for the projects I am now certain to be Greenfield, look for common denomination words to run a new classification. Main difficulties: the wordings on the descriptions are inconsistent to each other (best trends are vague: e.g. construction, new, IFIs). Search for other possible classification tools, end on brainstorming stage of troubleshooting.
